                "description": "This protocol ensures that a long enough break happens between doses allowing for the contrast between the normal days and microdosing days to become apparent. This is deeply important in terms of understanding the benefits of microdosing in your life. The first day after microdosing is what some call the ‘afterglow’ day. A time when the residue from the previous dosage of psilocybin still lingers. The second day after microdosing is what we call a ‘normal’ day. This is when your system is restored to your unique level of homeostasis.",

The protocol is designed for medium to advanced microdosers and is not recommended for beginners. The addition of Niacin is intended to increase the absorption of active mushroom compounds throughout the body. The protocol consists of four days on and three days off, with a maximum duration of one month, followed by a two to four-week break. Lion's Mane can also be consumed on the off-days.",

While the benefits are based on anecdotal reports and more research is needed, microdosers have reported feeling refreshed in the morning and avoiding mild nausea associated with morning microdosing.",
