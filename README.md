## About The Project

Psydiary is a web application for users to track and journal their experiences with microdosing psychedelic mushrooms. The self reflection and data a user gathers on themselves is crucial to their journey. It will help them know what's working, if it‚Äôs time to change the frequency of their microdosing routine, or if they need a break from microdosing altogether. Users can document the following daily metrics;

* Mood
* Sleep Quality
* Anxiety Score
* Depression Score
* Energy Levels
* Sociability
* Meditation Time
* Exercise Type

Users can also gain insight from their microdose protocols and journal their experience through tracking;
* Dosage
* Time Taken
* Mood Before and After
* Environment
* Sociability
* Journal Response to an AI Generated Prompt

Psydiary hopes to provide a structured way for users to track their experience with self-guided-treatment.

### PsyDiary Design

For our service architecture we decided to split our front end from our backend. The diagram below shows the way in which our services interact. For the backend repo, click the link below.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
To keep track of our progress while creating Psydiary, bugs that popped up, potential refactor ideas, and more... we utilized a [Notion Project Management Board](https://alluring-phlox-b74.notion.site/72a9807f1fec4b40a63d0fc8908cb7e8?v=aec33fee246f41b5bf8e7ae6ea7f9796) from Day 1.

We also used tools like Miro to diagram our database and service structure and Figma to create our wireframes.
